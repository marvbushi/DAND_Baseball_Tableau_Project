# DAND_Baseball_Tableau_Project
### Introduction
For this project, I create a data visualization using Tableau that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in a data set. This work is a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

### Summary
In this project, I explored and analyzed the relationships between variables, such as, homeruns, weight, height, batting average, and handedness. The dataset contain 1,157 baseball players. The dataset was provided by Udacity.

### Design
I wanted to explore how weight and height influences the homeruns and batting average by plotting it distributions.
- Player counts is represented by pie chart colored by handedness. The plot show us the number of records in the dataset.
- Handedness vs Homeruns is represented by bar chart colored by the average. The plot show us the count of homeruns by handedness.
- Average vs Homeruns is represented by bar chart colored by average. The plot show us that players with 0.20 or 0.25 batting average have the majority of homeruns.
- Height vs Average and Weight vs Average are represented in a bar chart in a Tableau Dashboard. By examining the plot, an excellent hitter should measure 72 inch and weight 184 lb.
- Height vs Homeruns and Weight vs Homeruns are represented in a bar chart in a Tableau Dashboard. By examining the plot, an excellent hitter should measure 72 inch and weight 184 lb.
- Weight and Height is represented in bar chart with trend line colored by homeruns count and average. It show us how weight and height affect overall performance of player. When weight and height increases performance decreaces.
- In order to explorer players in our dataset, an scoring level was created to categorized them represented by a scatter plot colored by the scoring categories. Filters were applied to make it interactive. We can find out who the are excellent, very good, good, fair players in our dataset.

### Feedback
- Try to balance the chart space and empty white space on each story point slide. Some of the slides have the charts pushed way over to one side. To do this you can expand the chart by clicking and dragging the far margin of the graph at the axis only. Another option that might work well with the first couple slides would be to group charts together into dashboards.
- Charts are more user-friendly when they include titles. In my experience people almost instinctively look for titles in the upper margin of a chart to help figure out what a chart is plotting. Please add concise but descriptive titles to all of your charts. You may have noticed that Tableau deactivates the titles of charts that are added to a story point as a single worksheet. To get around this, try first placing the single chart onto a dashboard, then into the story point.
- The chart below needs some context and would best be paired with a chart that plots the average per player per level of handedness. The chart as you have it doesn't control for the big differences in the number of players per level of handedness. Taking the average will control for this a give a better picture of performance by handedness.
- Try reformatting the batting average numbers. Traditionally batting average is presented as a decimal to three places of accuracy. You can learn more about how to reformat numbers here.
